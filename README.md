# DCGAN
Image generation using a deep convolutional generative adversarial network(DCGAN).

To run, you will need the following folders:

      - "dataset" which contains other folders with your data
      
      - "checkpoints" where you copy and paste the most recent checkpoints
      
      - "outputs" where you can find examples made by your model while it was training.

The Excel Speadsheet is a tool I quickly threw together to act as a size calculator for convolutions and "transposed" convolutions.

I may make a macro later.
